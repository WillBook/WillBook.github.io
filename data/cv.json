        "journal": "CPDE",
        "year": 2021,
        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the uniqueness of solutions to the 3d Navier-Stokes equations with initial vorticity given by $\\omega_0 = \\alpha e_z \\delta_{x = y = 0}$, where is the one dimensional Hausdorff measure of an infinite, vertical line and is an arbitrary circulation. This initial data corresponds to an idealized, infinite vortex filament. One smooth, mild solution is given by the self-similar Oseen vortex column, which coincides with the heat evolution. Previous work by Germain, Harrop-Griffiths, and the first author implies that this solution is unique within a class of mild solutions that converge to the Oseen vortex in suitable self-similar weighted spaces. In this paper, the uniqueness class of the Oseen vortex is expanded to include any solution that converges to the initial data in a sufficiently strong sense. This gives further evidence in support of the expectation that the Oseen vortex is the only possible mild solution that is identifiable as a vortex filament. The proof is a 3d variation of a 2d compactness/rigidity argument in $t \\searrow 0$ originally due to Gallagher and Gallay.",

        "year": 2023,
        "journal": "SIAM SIMA",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the regularity properties of bounded entropy solutions to the isentropic Euler equations with $\\gamma = 3$. First, we use a blow-up technique to obtain a new trace theorem for all such solutions. Second, we use a modified De Giorgi type iteration on the kinetic formulation to show a new partial regularity result on the Riemann invariants. We are able to conclude that in fact for any bounded entropy solution u, the density ρ is almost everywhere upper semicontinuous away from vacuum. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nonlinear hyperbolic system, which fails to be Temple class, but has the property that generic $L^\\infty$ initial data give rise to bounded entropy solutions with a form of near classical regularity. This provides one example that $2\\times 2$ hyperbolic systems can possess some of the more striking regularizing effects known to hold generically in the genuinely nonlinear, multidimensional scalar setting. While we are not able to use our regularity results to show unconditional uniqueness, the results substantially lower the likelihood that current methods of convex integration can be used in this setting.",

        "abstract": "We consider the Landau equation with Coulomb potential in the spatially homogeneous case. We show short time propagation of smallness in $L^p$ norms for $p>3/2$ and instantaneous regularization in Sobolev spaces. This yields new short time quantitative a priori estimates that are unconditional near equilibrium. We combine these estimates with existing literature on global well-posedness for regular data to extend the well-posedness theory to small $L^p$ data with p arbitrarily close to 3/2. The threshold $p=3/2$ agrees with previous work on conditional regularity for the Landau equation in the far from equilibrium regime. In light of the monotonicity of the Fisher information shown in the recent preprint [arXiv:2311.09420], our primary nonlinear regularization estimate holds even in the far-from-equilibrium regime. As a consequence, we obtain exponential convergence to equilibrium for suitably localized solutions in every Sobolev norm.",

        "abstract": "We consider the homogeneous Landau equation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with Coulomb potential and initial data in polynomially weighted $L^{3/2}$. We show that there exists a smooth solution that is bounded for all positive times. The proof is based on short-time regularization estimates for the Fisher information, which, combined with the recent result of Guillen and Silvestre, yields the existence of a global-in-time smooth solution. \\n Additionally, if the initial data belongs to $L^p$ with $p>3/2$, there is a unique solution. At the crux of the result is a new $\\varepsilon$-regularity criterion in the spirit of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem: a solution which is small in weighted $L^{3/2}$ is regular. Although the $L^{3/2}$ norm is a critical quantity for the Landau-Coulomb equation, using this norm to measure the regularity of solutions presents significant complications. For instance, the $L^{3/2}$ norm alone is not enough to control the $L^\\infty$ norm of the competing reaction and diffusion coefficients. These analytical challenges caused prior methods relying on the parabolic structure of the Landau-Coulomb to break down. Our new framework is general enough to handle slowly decaying and singular initial data, and provides the first proof of global well-posedness for the Landau-Coulomb equation with rough initial data.",
